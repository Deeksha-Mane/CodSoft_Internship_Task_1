CodSoft Internship Task 1: Landing Page
<br>
Technologies Used: HTML,CSS,JavaScript
<br>
As a part of my internship, I have developed and designed a landing page of a website which provides online programming courses to the programmers.The goal was to design a visually appealing and user-friendly page that actively promotes the courses and also aims to engage potential students,showcase course features and drive enrollments.
This landing page ensures a seamless user experiencce across various devices and screen sizes.The CTA's are placed strategically to encourage users to explore the available courses and enroll.I have also incorporated some interactive features to enhance user engagement.
Built the page structure using HTML and styled it using CSS and made some components alive by using JavaScript! I have followed the best Web-development practices in this project and I intend to continue iterating and adding new features to take it to the next level...
This project allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting and even made me a better programmer...!
